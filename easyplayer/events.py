class EventManager(AutoUnload):
    """Manage both GameEvents and custom events in a uniform manner.

    Simply provide your PlayerDictionary as an argument,
    and have the GameEvent's userids be converted to your
    custom Player entities automatically:

    >>> player_dict = PlayerDictionary(MyCustomPlayer)
    >>> events = EventManager(player_dict)
    >>> @events.on('player_jump')
    ... def on_player_jump(player, **eargs):
    ...     assert type(player) == MyCustomPlayer

    You can also provide custom GameEvent names if the defaults
    aren't suitable for your needs:

    >>> event_names = {'enter_bombzone', 'exit_bombzone'}
    >>> events = EventManager(player_dict, event_names)
    >>> @events.on('enter_bombzone')
    ... def on_enter_bombzone(player, **eargs):
    ...     assert type(player) == MyCustomPlayer

    By default, all the GameEvents with an attacker and
    a victim have been split up into two events:

    - player_blind => player_blind and player_go_blind
    - player_death => player_kill and player_death
    - player_hurt => player_attack and player_victim

    These can be disabled or modified through the optional
    `two_player_game_event_map` keyword argument:

    >>> my_two_player_game_event_map = {
    ...     # game_event: (attacker_event, victim_event),
    ...     'player_death': ('player_kill', 'player_killed'),
    ...     # Not providing other events disables them!
    ... }
    >>> events = EventManager(
    ...     player_dict,
    ...     two_player_game_event_map=my_two_player_game_event_map
    ... )

    Finally, you can add custom events with `create_event()` and
    fire them using the Â´[]` syntax:

    >>> events = EventManager(player_dict)
    >>> events.create_event('my_custom_event')
    >>> @events.on('my_custom_event')
    ... def on_my_custom_event(**eargs):
    ...     print(eargs)
    ...
    >>> events['my_custom_event'].fire(name=player.name, foo='bar')
    {'name': 'Mahi', 'foo': 'bar'}
